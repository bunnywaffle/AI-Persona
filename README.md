# AI-Persona

# How to install

AI Persona was specifically designed to work with OBBABOGA Web UI, which is a user interface for running LLMs. 
OBBABOGA provides a simple and intuitive way to give charector to LLMs, and AI Persona integrates seamlessly with it.

# Here's how you can use AI Persona with OBBABOGA:

Configure AI Persona: 

As mentioned earlier, create a JSON file named persona.json containing the configuration settings for your AI persona. Replace the values in the JSON file with your own preferences.

# Run the AI persona: 

* In the OBBABOGA interface, click on the "Charector" button.

* Select the JSON file containing the charector file for your AI persona.

* And then upload the json file into upload charector.

# Interact with the AI persona: 

Now you can interact with your AI persona using the LLM model. 

Type your questions or commands into the text box provided by OBBABOGA, and the AI persona will respond based on the LLM model.
